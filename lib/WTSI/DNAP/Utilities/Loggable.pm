=head1 NAME

WTSI::DNAP::Utilities::Loggable

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a logging facility via Log::Log4perl. When consumed, this
role automatically delegates Log::Log4perl logging method calls to a
logger. If no logger is configured a default will be created where the
root logger is configured to WARN to STDERR.

The default logger returned by the 'logger' method is named after the
fully qualified name of the Moose meta class e.g.

 WTSI::NPG::iRODS

has a default logger addressable by the string

 log4perl.logger.WTSI.NPG.iRODS

Broader logging may be enabled by configuring a logger higher up the
class hierarchy e.g.

 log4perl.logger.WTSI.NPG

will configure loggers under the WTSI::NPG.iRODS hierarchy. As per the
log4perl documentation, different classes may be configured to log at
different levels and to different locations. Please see the Log4perl
FAQ if you observe logging that you do not expect e.g. duplicate
messages; there are tips in the FAQ on that topic.
